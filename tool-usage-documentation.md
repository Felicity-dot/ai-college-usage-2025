# Tool Usage Documentation

A diverse range of AI tools were used throughout the creation of this article, spanning research, writing, visualization, coding, and media generation. This section outlines how each was used to deliver a high-quality, data-driven, visually engaging white paper.

## 1. ChatGPT (GPT-4o)
**Purpose:** Research, writing, editing, HTML formatting, prompt crafting  
**Usage:** ChatGPT was the central assistant for planning the structure of the article, refining tone and wording, ensuring SEO keyword integration, and generating clean HTML. It was also used to test prompt iterations and evaluate best practices in AI tool usage by students.

## 2. Claude 3 (Anthropic)
**Purpose:** Draft enhancement, tone refinement, factual expansion  
**Usage:** Claude was used to rewrite certain sections (e.g., introduction and conclusion) with a more natural academic tone. Its ability to process large documents helped improve transitions and continuity across the article.

## 3. Perplexity AI
**Purpose:** Factual verification, citation finding  
**Usage:** Perplexity was key in locating up-to-date statistics from 2023–2025. It helped source and link to real data from Pew Research, EDUCAUSE, Statista, and relevant Reddit threads, ensuring every claim was backed by a credible citation.

## 4. Gemini (Google AI)
**Purpose:** Trend analysis, summarizing long-form articles  
**Usage:** Gemini was used to extract relevant insights from recent studies and academic papers, especially around AI use in higher education. It summarized dense content into usable insights for segmentation.

## 5. Canva
**Purpose:** Infographic and chart design  
**Usage:** Canva was used to create a custom infographic summarizing key insights about AI adoption trends, and to format charts in a consistent visual style using the maroon color scheme (#89375F). Visuals were exported in high resolution for web publishing.

## 6. Chart.js + ChartGPT
**Purpose:** Custom interactive data visualizations  
**Usage:** Two key charts — a horizontal bar chart and a pie chart — were built using Chart.js. The initial data structure and label formatting were assisted by ChartGPT, which helped generate clean chart configuration objects in JavaScript.

## 7. DALL·E 3
**Purpose:** Background imagery for visual storytelling  
**Usage:** DALL·E generated a realistic academic-themed background showing college students interacting with futuristic AI interfaces. This background was used in the infographic and the animated video for visual context.

## 9. GitHub Pages
**Purpose:** Web publishing  
**Usage:** After the article was finalized, a polished HTML version was deployed to GitHub Pages for live access and technical validation. This allowed real-time testing of interactive elements (charts, filters, FAQ accordion) in a browser environment. It also served as a professional delivery format, demonstrating front-end integration without relying on CMS platforms.

## 10. Notion AI
**Purpose:** Task organization and brainstorming  
**Usage:** Although not directly embedded in the writing workflow, Notion AI was used during the research phase to brainstorm key sections, organize links, and generate early outlines of tool comparisons from community forums.
